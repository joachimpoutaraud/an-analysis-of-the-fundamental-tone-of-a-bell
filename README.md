# An analysis of the fundamental tone of a bell

This repository consists of the analysis of the harmonic tuning of a 14th century bell. We will start by finding its fundamental tone and convert the audio signal to a chromagram representation in order to ease the visualization of the three characteristic notes of the bell.

# Prerequisites

- numpy (to implement fft)
- scipy (to find peaks)
- matplotlib (for graphing)
- librosa (to load audio file)
- IPython.display (to listen to audio file)
